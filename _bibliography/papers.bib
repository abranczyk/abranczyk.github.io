  abstract={Squeezed states are a versatile class of quantum states with applications ranging from quantum computing to high-precision detection. We propose a method for generating tunable squeezed vacuum states of light with multiple modes encoded in frequency bins. Our method uses custom-engineered spontaneous parametric down-conversion pumped by a pulse-shaped pump field. The multimode squeezed states are generated in a single pass and can be tuned in real time by adjusting the properties of the pump field. Exploring new quantum states of light, encoded in new degrees of freedom, can be a fruitful path toward discovering new quantum applications.}

abstract = {The ideal photon-pair source for building up multi-qubit states needs to produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency. Indistinguishability is crucial for minimising errors in two-photon interference, central to building larger states, while high heralding rates will be needed to overcome unfavourable loss scaling. Domain engineering in parametric down-conversion sources negates the need for lossy spectral filtering allowing one to satisfy these conditions inherently within the source design. Here, we present a telecom-wavelength parametric down-conversion photon source that operates on the achievable limit of domain engineering. We generate photons from independent sources which achieve two-photon interference visibilities of up to 98.6\&\#x2009;\&\#x00B1;\&\#x2009;1.1\&\#x0025; without narrow-band filtering. As a consequence, we reach net heralding efficiencies of up to 67.5\&\#x0025;, which corresponds to collection efficiencies exceeding 90\&\#x0025;.},

In this paper we tailor the joint spectral wave-function of photons created in parametric downconversion by engineering the nonlinearity profile of a poled crystal. We design a crystal with an approximately Gaussian nonlinearity profile and confirm successful wave-packet shaping by two-photon interference experiments. We numerically show how our method can be applied for attaining one of the currently most important goals of single-photon quantum optics, the creation of pure single photons without spectral correlations.},

title = {Optimized generation of heralded Fock states using parametric down-conversion},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The generation of heralded pure Fock states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (PDC) relies on perfect photon-number correlations in the output modes. Correlations in any other degree of freedom, however, degrade the purity of the heralded state. In this paper, we investigate spectral entanglement between the two output modes of a periodically poled waveguide. With the intent of generating heralded one- and two-photon Fock states, we expand the output state of the PDC to second order in photon number. We explore the effects of spectral filtering and inefficient detection, of the heralding mode, on the count rate, g(2), and purity of the heralded state, as well as the fidelity between the resulting state and an ideal Fock state. We find that filtering can decrease spectral correlations, however, at the expense of the count rate and increased photon-number mixedness in the heralded output state. As a physical example, we model a type II PP-KTP waveguide pumped by lasers at wavelengths of 400ânm, 788ânm and 1.93âÎŒm. The latter two allow the fulfillment of extended phase-matching conditions in an attempt to eliminate spectral correlations in the PDC output state without the use of filtering; however, we find that, even in these cases, some filtering is needed to achieve states of very high purity.}

abstract = {Photonic quantum technology relies on efficient sources of coherent single photons, the ideal carriers of quantum information. Heralded single photons from parametric down-conversion can approximate on-demand single photons to a desired degree, with high spectral purities achieved through group-velocity matching and tailored crystal nonlinearities. Here we propose crystal-nonlinearity-engineering techniques with sub-coherence-length domains. We first introduce a combination of two existing methods: a deterministic approach with coherence-length domains and probabilistic domain-width annealing. We then show how the same deterministic domain-flip approach can be implemented with sub-coherence-length domains. Both of these complementary techniques create highly pure photons, outperforming previous methods, in particular for short nonlinear crystals matched to femtosecond lasers.}

Given unitary operations with unknown rotation angles, our method can be used to reconstruct the density matrix of the state up to local  rotations as well as recover the magnitude of the unknown rotation angle. We demonstrate high-fidelity self-calibrating tomography on polarization-encoded one- and two-photon states. The unknown unitary operations are realized in two ways: using a birefringent polymer sheetâan inexpensive smartphone screen protectorâor alternatively a liquid crystal wave plate with a tuneable retardance. We explore how our technique may be adapted for QST of systems such as biological molecules where the magnitude and orientation of the transition dipole moment is not known with high accuracy.}

abstract = {The relationship between thermal light and coherent pulses is of fundamental and practical interest. We now know that thermal light cannot be represented as a statistical mixture of single pulses. In this paper, we ask whether or not thermal light can be represented as a statistical mixture of sets of pulses. We consider thermal light in a one-dimensional waveguide, and find a convex decomposition into products of orthonormal coherent states of localized, nonmonochromatic modes.},

title = {Self-calibrating quantum state tomography},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a technique for performing quantum state tomography (QST) on multiple-qubit states despite incomplete knowledge about the unitary operations used to change the measurement basis. Given unitary operations with unknown rotation angles, our method can be used to reconstruct the density matrix of the state up to local  rotations as well as recover the magnitude of the unknown rotation angle. We demonstrate high-fidelity self-calibrating tomography on polarization-encoded one- and two-photon states. The unknown unitary operations are realized in two ways: using a birefringent polymer sheetâan inexpensive smartphone screen protectorâor alternatively a liquid crystal wave plate with a tuneable retardance. We explore how our technique may be adapted for QST of systems such as biological molecules where the magnitude and orientation of the transition dipole moment is not known with high accuracy.}

title = {Optimized generation of heralded Fock states using parametric down-conversion},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The generation of heralded pure Fock states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (PDC) relies on perfect photon-number correlations in the output modes. Correlations in any other degree of freedom, however, degrade the purity of the heralded state. In this paper, we investigate spectral entanglement between the two output modes of a periodically poled waveguide. With the intent of generating heralded one- and two-photon Fock states, we expand the output state of the PDC to second order in photon number. We explore the effects of spectral filtering and inefficient detection, of the heralding mode, on the count rate, g(2), and purity of the heralded state, as well as the fidelity between the resulting state and an ideal Fock state. We find that filtering can decrease spectral correlations, however, at the expense of the count rate and increased photon-number mixedness in the heralded output state. As a physical example, we model a type II PP-KTP waveguide pumped by lasers at wavelengths of 400ânm, 788ânm and 1.93âÎŒm. The latter two allow the fulfillment of extended phase-matching conditions in an attempt to eliminate spectral correlations in the PDC output state without the use of filtering; however, we find that, even in these cases, some filtering is needed to achieve states of very high purity.}
