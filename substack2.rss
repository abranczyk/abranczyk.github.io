week, Perimeter Institute hosted a conference on various topics related to casualty and quantum physics. One of the topics&#8212;quantum causal inference&#8212;had been on my radar for some time, so I signed up to attend. </p><p>It had been a few years since I was at an academic conference where there would be so many first- and second-order connections. I was a bit self-conscious about answering the questions &#8220;what do you do now?&#8221; or &#8220;where are you (working) now?&#8221;. </p><p>I mean, I would happily talk someone&#8217;s ear off about my grand vision and mission for Aggie Branczyk Enterprises (ABE)&#8212;but there&#8217;s a time and place for that kind of thing, and the coffee break at an academic conference isn&#8217;t it. On the other hand, the short version sounds a bit like: &#8220;I&#8217;m throwing mud at a wall to see what sticks&#8221;. So I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I would say.  </p><h4>What are you working on?</h4><p>It turns out that I didn&#8217;t have to overthink it, because most people asked me a different question: &#8220;What are you <strong>working on</strong>?&#8221; That might sound very similar to, &#8220;What do you do?&#8221;, but &#8220;What do you do?&#8221; means, &#8220;What is your job title?&#8221; And at academic conferences, no one really asks that (at least not to middle-aged people like me) because they just assume that part of your job is to be a researcher, and that&#8217;s the only part that matters. The question, &#8220;What are you working on?&#8221;, then implicitly means, &#8220;What <strong>research</strong> are you working on?&#8221;</p><p>That one was easy to wing: &#8220;My background is in quantum optics, but I&#8217;ve been in industry for a while and hadn&#8217;t done much research. Now I&#8217;m exploring new areas, to decide what I should work on next. Quantum causal inference is one of the areas I&#8217;m exploring.&#8221; The conversation then typically stayed on research. </p><p>Now&#8230;that seems <em>completely</em> normal if you&#8217;re an academic, but for someone who had been away from academia for a while, it was refreshing.</p><h4>How are you funding it?</h4><p>A couple of times, however, the conversation did steer towards the topic of my company<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. In which case, it led to questions around VC funding. </p><p>I think it&#8217;s a fair assumption that most physics academics aren't very familiar with starting and running companies, but in quantum-adjacent fields, almost everyone knows someone who started a quantum tech startup. So they kind of have this idea that when you start a company, you apply for funding&#8230;usually VC funding<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>. </p><p>So the idea that I wasn&#8217;t fundraising seemed to them a bit weird. But the plan is for ABE to do a mix of consulting, community-building, training, education and theoretical research. This doesn&#8217;t need much capital to get started, and revenue comes quite quickly<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>, especially on the consulting side.</p><p>Similar things can be said for many kinds of software companies, and even some small-scale (classical) hardware companies, like those building robots from off-the shelf components and 3D printed parts. Rather than going the VC route, it&#8217;s possible to do something called <em>bootstrapping</em> where you fund the venture yourself (and/or with some help from your friends &amp; family). You can still apply for VC funding when it&#8217;s time to scale, but this can be done at a much later stage, after you&#8217;ve found product-market-fit and have customers.</p><p>The advantages of doing this include having freedom over the direction of your company, as well as being able to focus on building the technology/product/company, without the distraction of fundraising. A major disadvantage is not having any income until you sell something, so you have to either do this on the side of your day job, or you have to plan ahead and save some money to support yourself for a while<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a>. And you have to be willing to work on the company for free until it makes money. </p><p>I&#8217;m not making any claims about which way is better, but just making a point that there are different approaches, and it&#8217;s worth considering all of them before making a decision of how you want to build your company.</p><h4>But what about deep tech startups?</h4><p>Deep tech startups are different to regular tech startups<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a>. They need lab space, expensive equipment, and highly qualified personnel. That ain&#8217;t cheap. So the conventional wisdom is that they take even longer to become profitable, and require even more funding.</p><p>It seems like bootstrapping a deep tech company wouldn&#8217;t be possible, but I&#8217;m intrigued about the idea of a maker-space for experimental physicists&#8212;a place with lab space, rooms of lasers, etc, that people could hang out in and tinker with and develop their technologies. </p><p>Isn&#8217;t that called grad school? Yeah, I guess&#8230;but somehow I&#8217;m imagining something different&#8230;something outside of academia. </p><p>I think the Quantum Nanofab Facility at the Quantum Nano Center in Waterloo and DevTeQ at DistriQ in Sherbrooke might be approximations of what I&#8217;m imagining, but I think those are more for already-funded startups to rent out&#8230;and again, I&#8217;m imagining something outside of academia. </p><p>The idea of this kind of maker-space for experimental physicists has independently come up in several conversations I&#8217;ve had in the last month, so I think something might be in the air.</p><h4>So how&#8217;s this new life going so far?</h4><p>I&#8217;m having a wonderful time, but my biggest challenge as always is limiting the number of things that I want to do at once. I&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks talking to a lot of people and getting lots of new ideas, but I need to reign in the networking next week and sit down and actually make some progress on the boring, but oh so important, parts of building the company.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://aggieinc.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Aggie Inc.!

They regularly run <a href="https://startupbarn.substack.com">tech-focused events</a>, and it looks like Dev House has moved there now too. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:957933,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43254b71-2fb9-4be7-a0fa-706be2bd251a_3000x2250.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Last Monday&#8217;s Dev House</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>(Side note: I&#8217;m planning to host a local in-person <strong>Academics in the Wild</strong> event here in the Fall.

week, I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agata-branczyk_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7232475814666117120-M3M5">posted on LinkedIn</a> about starting a <em>lifestyle business</em>, and I realized that not everyone will be familiar with that term, especially those from academic backgrounds. If you&#8217;ve never heard it before, the phrase might sound a bit like&#8230;um&#8230;maybe I&#8217;ll be selling smoothies &amp; yoga mats or something? &#128517; </p><p>Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that&#8230;but it&#8217;s not what I have in mind!</p><h3>So what <em>is</em> a lifestyle business?</h3><p>There are various ways of defining it, but the one that matches what I have in mind is this one:</p><blockquote><p>A lifestyle business is a type of business that is designed to support the owner&#8217;s preferred lifestyle rather than solely focusing on maximizing profits or achieving high levels of growth. Owners of lifestyle businesses prioritize personal goals, such as flexibility, work-life balance, and the pursuit of their passions, over the traditional business objective of maximizing profits. (<a href="https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/lifestyle-business/">source</a>)</p></blockquote><h3>Hey&#8230;what&#8217;s wrong with profit?</h3><p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m all for companies focusing on profit. Anyone with a pension or any other investment should want the companies they invest in to be profitable. The question is: do <em>I</em>, personally, want to be the builder of such a company. And the answer is: no.</p><p>In recent years, many of my friends and colleagues from academia started quantum tech startups. Such startups are typically backed by venture capital (VC). This means that people with money gave that money to a VC who then invested that money in a startup. At some point, say after 5 to 10 years, those investors will want the money they invested&#8212;plus a handsome profit&#8212;to come back to them. That&#8217;s the name of the game, and I think it&#8217;s great these mechanisms exist. In many cases, it&#8217;s the only way to build the kinds of technology and products that these companies want to build. </p><p>But this puts a great deal of pressure on the company and the founders. I have the absolute utmost respect and admiration for my friends and colleagues who went down this path. It&#8217;s just not for me (at least not now). </p><h3>Don&#8217;t people look down on lifestyle businesses?</h3><p>Some people do. In VC circles, the term <em>lifestyle business</em> is sometimes used pejoratively, suggesting that such businesses lack ambition or potential. This totally makes sense if the thing you care about is a return on your investment. I would not be investing money in someone else&#8217;s lifestyle business either. But lifestyle businesses <em>can</em> be ambitious and have potential in their own way. They can do great work and bring value and satisfaction to their clients. And they can support a sustainable and fulfilling career for their owners. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m after!</p><h3>What kind of lifestyle are you trying to support?</h3><p>According to the definition above, one of the goals of a lifestyle business is that it supports the owner&#8217;s preferred lifestyle. This brings to mind a business that makes enough money, and leaves its owner with enough time, that they can spend their days playing golf or sailing a yacht or something. That&#8217;s not exactly what I&#8217;m interested in though. </p><p>When I left academia, I left for various reasons. Those reasons hold even more true today. But even though I don&#8217;t want to return to academia, I do want to reclaim some of the aspects I loved about it, like autonomy and intellectual freedom. I want control over my schedule and the freedom to choose the people I work with. I want the ability to take long lunches, and the opportunity to engage in deep, intellectual discussions with colleagues. But at the same time, I want the things I discovered I loved while in industry, like speed, execution, big strategic thinking, and connection with the real world. </p><p>I actually really like work&#8230;a lot more than entertainment. I&#8217;m just picky about the nature of that work. The lifestyle that I want to support is the one that lets me work in a way that is right for me, and on things that align with my passions and my values. </p><h3>What&#8217;s up with your funny company name?</h3><p>I thought a lot about what to call the company. I think the name should reflect what a company does, and I couldn&#8217;t settle on doing just one thing. I want to try all of the things and figure out which ones work and which ones don&#8217;t. So I called the company<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> Aggie Branczyk Enterprises (ABE). It&#8217;s the best description of what the company does&#8230;and it makes me laugh. </p><h3>What will the company do?</h3><p>ABE will consist of different divisions, one for each venture, each with its own service/product, business model, and brand identity. I will also leave room for a division called ABE Research, in which I will do foundational research driven by my own curiosity. Like its counterparts in much larger companies such as IBM and GE, the Research division will not directly generate revenue, but will be supported financially by its parent company.</p><p>This sounds like a lot for one person to take on, but my goal is to structure the business in a way that allows me to work at a sustainable pace. In this Substack, I&#8217;ll share how I plan to do that, as well as what I learn along the way as I explore different ventures and business models. I&#8217;ll also talk about why I wanted to think of this as a company rather than to work as a freelancer that takes on various projects (which would have been a lot easier!). </p><h3>Stick around</h3><p>So, here we are. I&#8217;m diving into this journey with excitement and realism, aiming to build something meaningful on my own terms. If you&#8217;re interested in creating a life and work that feels right for you, or if you&#8217;re just curious to see how this experiment unfolds, stick around. I&#8217;ll be glad that you&#8217;re here for the ride. </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://aggieinc.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Aggie Inc.!
