In this post, I&#8217;ll walk you through the different business structures in Canada, and how I decided which one I wanted. </p><p>(Please see the obligatory disclaimer at the end of this post.) </p><h1>Registering a business in Canada</h1><p>When registering a business in Canada, you have three choices:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Sole proprietorship:</strong> the default business structure for a single owner. </p></li><li><p><strong>General partnership:</strong> the default business structure for multiple owners. </p></li><li><p><strong>Corporation:</strong> a separate legal entity. </p></li></ul><p>I don&#8217;t plan to have any partners. So a general partnership doesn&#8217;t make sense. This leaves me with a choice between a <em>sole proprietorship</em> and a <em>corporatio</em>n.</p><h1>Sole Proprietorship or Corporation?</h1><p>When making this decision, there are several things you might want to weigh up. The big ones are <em>legal status</em> and <em>complexity/cost</em>. Let&#8217;s start with those first. </p><h2>Legal status</h2><p>This refers to how the business is viewed under the law. A sole proprietorship and a corporation have very different legal identities.</p><p>For a sole proprietorship, <em>you</em> are the business&#8212;legally speaking, there&#8217;s no separation between your personal and business finances, liabilities, or responsibilities</p><p>A corporation, on the other hand, is like its own legal person, separate from you and the other owners.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg" width="1456" height="969" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2675512,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42bbc4a5-c4b3-4fd6-97a0-da8f31e4e5ca_1920x1278.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Somehow talking about corporations being people makes me think of this guy. </figcaption></figure></div><p>This has several benefits. One of them is that you have limited liability<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>, meaning if things go sideways, your personal assets are <em>generally</em> safe from business debts or legal trouble.</p><p>It&#8217;s also nice whenever you have to get into a contract or formal agreement with another entity. Say you&#8217;re hiring a sub-contractor, or employee, or you&#8217;re being hired by another company. The contracts and agreements are between the other entity and your company, not you personally. </p><p>This adds a layer of professionalism and protection. But it also makes things less awkward when you&#8217;re operating in a tight-knit community like quantum tech, where you know most of the people from academia or previous jobs. There are things that can be uncomfortable to negotiate with friends and acquaintances, but when it&#8217;s your company talking to their company, it creates some distance where you can frame things more rationally. </p><p>The separate legal status and liability protection was, for me, the main reason that I was interested in registering as a corporation. But is it worth the complexity and cost?</p><h2>Complexity and Cost</h2><p>My main hesitation about registering as a corporation was the potential complexity and cost. So I wanted to drill down and see what that involves. We can break it down into the initial <em>process of incorporation</em> and the <em>ongoing responsibilities</em>. </p><h3>Process of incorporation</h3><p>From talking to people in the community, I learnt that there are pretty much three ways to do this:</p><ol><li><p>Use a lawyer ($2-3K)</p></li><li><p>Use a service like Ownr ($500)</p></li><li><p>Do it yourself ($200 federal or $360 provincial)</p></li></ol><p>When you incorporate, there is a formal step of actually getting incorporated. This is pretty straightforward&#8212;you can do it through the Government of Canada <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/business/start/register-with-gov/register-corp.html">website</a>. </p><p>Then there is a bunch of one-off stuff you have to do just <em>after</em> you&#8217;re incorporated. I think the value of getting a lawyer or using Ownr is in helping with that other stuff after incorporation. </p><p>But for a one-person business, this other stuff isn&#8217;t that wild, and you <em>can</em> do it yourself. Essentially, it comes down to preparing and signing a document called a written resolution (in lieu of an organizational meeting) to make the by-laws, issue shares to yourself, and appoint yourself to all the officer positions. Then, you have to prepare and sign another written resolution (in lieu of the first shareholders meeting) to elect yourself as the sole shareholder and director. You can get templates for all of these documents online.<br><br>The general steps are outlined in <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/business-corporations/next-steps-following-incorporation-your-business">this guide</a>, which looks scary, but like I said, when you&#8217;re one person, it simplifies a lot. I have another post in the works where I explain how each of those steps maps to a one-person business. </p><p>What about ongoing responsibilities?</p><h3>Ongoing responsibilities</h3><p>As an incorporated business, you&#8217;re responsible for some ongoing things. </p><h4>Corporate taxes</h4><p>The big ongoing cost and responsibility will be to file corporate taxes. Again, if you&#8217;re keeping good records and the company isn&#8217;t too complicated, this shouldn&#8217;t be that much more onerous than doing your taxes as a sole proprietor. While I do my personal taxes myself, for business taxes it&#8217;s probably worth getting an accountant to make sure you&#8217;re not screwing anything up. Word on the street is that this could set you back $1-1.5K per year. </p><h4>Annual shareholders meeting</h4><p>You&#8217;re supposed to have an <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/business-corporations/share-structure-and-shareholders">annual shareholders meeting</a>, but for a company of one, you&#8217;re not going to meet with yourself, so you just write a resolution in lieu of that meeting. You can find templates for that online too. </p><h4>Keep your corporation in good standing</h4><p>To keep your corporation in good standing, you have to do a <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/business-corporations/next-steps-following-incorporation-your-business">few other things</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/business-corporations/next-steps-following-incorporation-your-business#toc-02.01">Filing an annual return</a></strong>: Filing an annual return for a business corporation provides up-to-date information to Corporations Canada.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/individuals-significant-control-file-your-information">Filing the ISC information</a></strong>: Information on the corporation's individuals with significant control (ISCs) must be filed at the same time as the annual return. Changes to ISC information must also be filed within 15 days of a change in the corporation's ISC register.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/business-corporations/next-steps-following-incorporation-your-business#toc-02.02">Filing a change of registered office address</a></strong>: Your registered office address is the official address for communications with your corporation.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/business-corporations/next-steps-following-incorporation-your-business#toc-02.03">Filing changes regarding directors</a></strong>: Interested stakeholders have a right to know who the current directors are and where they can be reached.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/business-corporations/changing-structure-or-nature-business-corporation#toc-01">Amending your articles</a></strong>: Your articles set out basic information about your corporation.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>These seem like pretty straightforward forms, and only the first one seems like a regular thing, with the others needing to be done when you make changes to the business. </p><h2>What else to consider?</h2><p>There are a few more things that you might want to consider when making your decision, but to me they seem less important than what I mentioned above. </p><h3>Who controls things?</h3><p>In general, in a sole proprietorship, the owner has total control, whereas in a corporation, control is shared between directors and shareholders. But for a single director and shareholder, the difference seems negligible. </p><h3>Profits</h3><p>In a sole proprietorship, all profits are paid directly to the owner, while in a corporation, profits are earned by the corporation and can be distributed to shareholders as dividends or retained within the corporation. Again, for a single director and shareholder, the difference seems negligible, since you can decide what to do with the profits. </p><h3>Taxation</h3><p>A sole proprietor is taxed personally on the business income as though they were employed, while a corporation pays taxes separately from its shareholders and directors. Again, for a single director and shareholder, the difference seems negligible. </p><h3>Funding</h3><p>I don&#8217;t plan to raise capital through the sale of shares, so that&#8217;s not really relevant. But I might want to apply for some small-business grants, or related funding, where incorporation might be important. </p><h1>What did I do?</h1><p>I decided to go with incorporation. For me, the big deciding factor was the <strong>separate legal status</strong>. I like the idea of having a bit of distance between myself and the business, especially when it comes to liability or formal agreements. I want to keep my personal assets out of the mix in case things go south.</p><p>The extra complexity and cost weren&#8217;t as bad as I expected. Incorporating through the Government of Canada <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/business/start/register-with-gov/register-corp.html">website</a> was actually super easy.

href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>So far, most of what I&#8217;ve been saying about Aggie Branczyk Enterprises has been from the angle of what the company means for me and how it can help me achieve my <a href="https://aggieinc.substack.com/p/whats-a-lifestyle-business">dream lifestyle</a>. That angle makes sense for this Substack. But it doesn&#8217;t really make sense for the company website. </p><h3>Goals</h3><p>When designing a company website, it&#8217;s important to think about who it&#8217;s for and what you want it to do. Often, your main audience is <em>potential</em> customers or clients and the goal is to turn them into <em>actual</em> ones. If you&#8217;re an early stage startup, your audience might be investors, and the main goal is to show them you know what you're doing so they&#8217;ll fund you. Getting a website to do either of these things requires skill and it&#8217;s probably better to get a professional to help. </p><p>Fortunately, my present goals are not so lofty because I&#8217;m not yet actively looking for customers or clients<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. My basic goals are just to establish an online presence, provide information about what the company does, direct people to other places (like this Substack and AITW) and give them a way to contact me. </p><p>I expect my goals to evolve over time. </p><h3>Tech</h3><p>I used to build my websites using Jekyll and hosted them on GitHub pages<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>. This was pretty good, and I still use it for my <a href="https://aggiebranczyk.com">personal page and blog</a>. But it became too cumbersome when I was building the AITW page and needed to iterate quickly as my ideas evolved (you can see the old page <a href="https://aggiebranczyk.com/academicsinthewild/">here</a>&#8230;but shield your eyes!). </p><p>A friend then introduced me to Carrd, which I just <em>love</em>. It&#8217;s extremely delightful to use. I used it to build the <a href="https://academicsinthewild.com">new</a> AITW page as well as the ABE page. I have the paid version because I wanted to be able to do forwards. </p><p>For domain purchase and management, I use Hover. Mainly because it&#8217;s also super user-friendly<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>  and the customer service has been quite good so far. They also have an option to get an email address and mailbox with your domain. </p><p>For stock images, I use Freepik. I have the paid version, which lets you use the images without attribution. </p><p>Btw, I&#8217;m not sponsored by any of these companies. I just like their products. </p><p>I&#8217;m using the domain <strong>aggiebranczyk.enterprises</strong>. Granted, no one knows how to spell my name, so it&#8217;s not like anyone is going to be typing it in. But I don&#8217;t think people use website addresses that way these days anyway. There is another <em>much</em> simpler domain that I <em>really</em> want, but it costs $4K USD per year, and I just don&#8217;t know how to justify that expense right now. </p><h3>Design and content</h3><p>I wanted something simple, that let me provide some basic info about the four ABE divisions, and some links. The template that I chose also had a little heading and some space for a tagline. It took me a while to figure out what to write, because it&#8217;s hard to find a unifying theme for ABE from the external perspective.

It might seem a bit weird for a company of one person to have an org chart, but it&#8217;s a useful framework for organizing my ideas.</p><p>The org chart should help me:</p><ul><li><p>Align internal company structure with what clients see on the website.</p></li><li><p>Make sure all the ideas and materials I&#8217;ve gathered over the years are captured.</p></li><li><p>Isolate different initiatives, so I can put some on the back burner, while still collecting relevant materials.</p></li><li><p>Eventually drop unviable initiatives without disrupting others.</p></li><li><p>Eventually scale successful initiatives by outsourcing non-specialized tasks, without impacting others.</p></li><li><p>Let me experiment with different business models.</p></li><li><p>Organize my folders, bookmarks, company dashboard, task management system etc in a way that&#8217;s easy to use.</p></li></ul><h3>Brain dump</h3><p>My ongoing problem is that I want to do too many things. I know I can&#8217;t do them all, so I need to figure out a way to prioritize. Before I can do that, I need to take stock of all of the things that I (think I) want to do. Cue the brain dump.</p><ul><li><p>Do research in quantum foundations ( = new &amp; aspirational)</p></li><li><p>Do research in quantum optics ( = familiar &amp; fun)</p></li><li><p>Improve the custom poling library I made a while back</p></li><li><p>Explore possibilities to do consulting related to the custom poling library</p></li><li><p>Consult for deep tech (initially quantum tech) startups (many ideas and directions this could go in)</p></li><li><p>Get more involved with the local tech ecosystem</p></li><li><p>Do a deep dive into quantum tech ecosystems, do some analysis, explore gaps</p></li><li><p>NSERC Discovery Grant Evaluation Group (existing voluntary commitment)</p></li><li><p>quantumoptics.fun (an idea for an educational website about quantum optics, aimed at grad students)</p></li><li><p>Be able to visit universities and talk to researchers</p></li><li><p>Be able to go to physics conferences</p></li><li><p>Grow the Academics in the Wild community (many ideas and directions this could go in)</p></li><li><p>Make Season 2 of the Physicists in the Wild podcast</p></li><li><p>Make a YouTube Shorts channel for PITW/AITW content</p></li><li><p>Finish and/or make a better version of the Writing Science course</p></li><li><p>Turn some of my career presentations into bite-sized videos</p></li><li><p>Develop hands-on career workshops for physics/math PhDs</p></li><li><p>Create a paid community/workshops/coaching service for academics who already transitioned into industry and are feeling stuck in their careers</p></li><li><p>Develop my proposed framework for doing research in public (DRiP)</p></li><li><p>Do a deep dive into the idea of independent research, highlighting past and present independent researchers, discussing pros and cons of academia, how things have changed etc&#8212;starting off as a series of articles, but maybe eventually a book?</p></li><li><p>Write and publish a picture book about interpersonal relationships/networking using physics memes</p></li><li><p>Create a Montessori-style grad (grad-alternative?) program for physicists</p></li><li><p>Document my entrepreneurial/independent scientist journey for people who might want to do the same one day</p></li></ul><p>That&#8217;s all I can think of for now&#8230;&#128517;</p><h3>Decisions</h3><p>I spent days iterating, making sketches, drawing diagrams, rearranging my bookmarks and folders. Maybe I was procrastinating, but it needed to be done to get the stuff out of my head. In any case, I have a hyperactive bias for action, so really forcing myself to slow down and get strategic is a good thing. I also have a serious case of aphantasia, so I have to externalize all of my thinking. Tinkering with the org chart was how I did that. </p><p>Some decisions I needed to make were:</p><ul><li><p>Should I include certain volunteer activities as pro-bono business activities or something I do as an individual? </p></li><li><p>Should content creation be a division or something internal I do in support of other divisions?</p></li><li><p>Should consulting be a division or something external I do in support of other divisions?</p></li><li><p>Should my activities in meta research (DRiP &amp; the independent researcher thing) go into the same Research division as the physics research? </p></li><li><p>Should Academics in the Wild be part of ABE? [I decided: yes<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>]</p></li></ul><p><strong>At one point, I thought I had it all figured out, but in the mean time, I had started talking to people, some of whom accidentally turned into potential and actual clients. This won&#8217;t surprise anyone who knows anything, but the clients had their own ideas for how I would be useful that hadn&#8217;t occurred to me. This led me to rearrange things again.</strong> </p><p>So it took longer than I hoped, but finally I&#8217;m at a point where I have a structure that I think I can operate in. It will probably change, but for now, it works. </p><h3>Divisions</h3><p>Aggie Branczyk Enterprises (ABE) will contain five divisions.</p><h4>ABE Research</h4><p>This division focuses on physics research (initially quantum optics and quantum foundations) and meta research (independent research &amp; open collaboration models outside of academia). </p><h5>Revenue model:</h5><ul><li><p><strong>Physics research:</strong> none; accepting external funding means accepting external influence and I want to have the freedom to pursue my own curiosity in this area. </p></li><li><p><strong>Meta research:</strong> grants; I&#8217;m less worried about external influence in this area, so am open to applying for external funding. </p></li></ul><h5>Current status</h5><ul><li><p><strong>Quantum foundations research:</strong> ACTIVE</p></li><li><p><strong>Quantum optics research:</strong> ON HOLD</p></li><li><p><strong>DRiP</strong>: ON HOLD</p></li><li><p><strong>Independent research chronicles:</strong> ON HOLD</p></li></ul><h4><strong>ABE Quantum Solutions</strong></h4><p>This division offers consulting services and specialized products, including ecosystem insights and intelligence resources, tailored for deep tech startups, with an initial focus on quantum technology.</p><h5><strong>Revenue model:</strong></h5><ul><li><p><strong>Consulting:</strong> consulting fees</p></li><li><p><strong>Products:</strong> one-time payments</p></li></ul><h5>Current status:</h5><ul><li><p><strong>Consulting:</strong> ACTIVE</p></li><li><p><strong>Products:</strong> PENDING</p></li></ul><h4>ABE Careers</h4><p>This division offers career and professional development services for physics and math PhDs, during and after their transition from academia. Services are available to individual participants, but funding can come from universities and employers investing in professional development for their students and staff.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> </p><h5><strong>Revenue model:</strong></h5><ul><li><p><strong>Workshops:</strong> session fees</p></li><li><p><strong>Community memberships:</strong> subscription</p></li><li><p><strong>Coaching:</strong> hourly or package fees</p></li><li><p><strong>Educational partnerships:</strong> custom pricing</p></li></ul><h5>Current status:</h5><ul><li><p><strong>Workshops:</strong> ACTIVE</p></li><li><p><strong>Community memberships:</strong> PENDING</p></li><li><p><strong>Coaching:</strong> PENDING</p></li><li><p><strong>Educational partnerships:</strong> ACTIVE</p></li></ul><h4>ABE Education</h4><p>This division offers specialized courses and resources for physics and math PhDs. Key offerings include quantumoptics.fun, a dedicated platform for quantum optics content and a scientific writing course designed to enhance scientific communication skills. This division is designed for scalability&#8212;after initial development, materials can be maintained and expanded with minimal hands-on involvement.</p><h5><strong>Revenue model:</strong></h5><ul><li><p>Partnerships with sponsors and relevant industry advertisers.</p></li></ul><h5>Current status:</h5><ul><li><p><strong>quantumoptics.fun:</strong> PENDING</p></li><li><p><strong>Scientific writing:</strong> ON HOLD</p></li></ul><h4>Academics in the Wild</h4><p>This division mainly focuses on the AITW community, which hosts virtual and in-person events for physics and math PhDs transitioning from academia (before, during, and after the transition). It will also include related content and resources. The focus is on providing free services and products.</p><h5><strong>Revenue model:</strong></h5><ul><li><p><strong>AITW community:</strong> most likely none; I&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of partnering with sponsors, but I think there&#8217;s a risk that this might negatively influence the direction of the community, so this idea is on hold for now. </p></li><li><p><strong>Video/audio content:</strong> partnerships with sponsors and relevant industry advertisers</p></li></ul><h5>Current status:</h5><ul><li><p><strong>AITW community:</strong> ACTIVE</p></li><li><p><strong>PITW podcast:</strong> ON HOLD</p></li><li><p><strong>PITW/AITW Shorts:</strong> PENDING</p></li></ul><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>So this is where I&#8217;m at now. Aggie Branczyk Enterprises is divided into five divisions, each with a specific focus: Research, Quantum Solutions, Careers, Education, and Academics in the Wild.

One of the topics&#8212;quantum causal inference&#8212;had been on my radar for some time, so I signed up to attend. </p><p>It had been a few years since I was at an academic conference where there would be so many first- and second-order connections. I was a bit self-conscious about answering the questions &#8220;what do you do now?&#8221; or &#8220;where are you (working) now?&#8221;. </p><p>I mean, I would happily talk someone&#8217;s ear off about <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/aggieinc/p/nice-company-but-what-does-it-do">my grand vision</a> and mission for Aggie Branczyk Enterprises (ABE)&#8212;but there&#8217;s a time and place for that kind of thing, and the coffee break at an academic conference isn&#8217;t it. On the other hand, the short version sounds a bit like: &#8220;I&#8217;m throwing mud at a wall to see what sticks&#8221;. So I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I would say.  </p><h4>What are you working on?</h4><p>It turns out that I didn&#8217;t have to overthink it, because most people asked me a different question: &#8220;What are you <strong>working on</strong>?&#8221; That might sound very similar to, &#8220;What do you do?&#8221;, but &#8220;What do you do?&#8221; means, &#8220;What is your job title?&#8221; And at academic conferences, no one really asks that (at least not to middle-aged people like me) because they just assume that part of your job is to be a researcher, and that&#8217;s the only part that matters. The question, &#8220;What are you working on?&#8221;, then implicitly means, &#8220;What <strong>research</strong> are you working on?&#8221;</p><p>That one was easy to wing: &#8220;My background is in quantum optics, but I&#8217;ve been in industry for a while and hadn&#8217;t done much research. Now I&#8217;m exploring new areas, to decide what I should work on next. Quantum causal inference is one of the areas I&#8217;m exploring.&#8221; The conversation then typically stayed on research. </p><p>Now&#8230;that seems <em>completely</em> normal if you&#8217;re an academic, but for someone who had been away from academia for a while, it was refreshing.</p><h4>How are you funding it?</h4><p>A couple of times, however, the conversation did steer towards the topic of my company<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. In which case, it led to questions around VC funding. </p><p>I think it&#8217;s a fair assumption that most physics academics aren't very familiar with starting and running companies, but in quantum-adjacent fields, almost everyone knows someone who started a quantum tech startup. So they kind of have this idea that when you start a company, you apply for funding&#8230;usually VC funding<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>. </p><p>So the idea that I wasn&#8217;t fundraising seemed to them a bit weird. But the plan is for ABE to do a mix of consulting, community-building, training, education and theoretical research. This doesn&#8217;t need much capital to get started, and revenue comes quite quickly<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>, especially on the consulting side.</p><p>Similar things can be said for many kinds of software companies, and even some small-scale (classical) hardware companies, like those building robots from off-the shelf components and 3D printed parts. Rather than going the VC route, it&#8217;s possible to do something called <em>bootstrapping</em> where you fund the venture yourself (and/or with some help from your friends &amp; family). You can still apply for VC funding when it&#8217;s time to scale, but this can be done at a much later stage, after you&#8217;ve found product-market-fit and have customers.</p><p>The advantages of doing this include having freedom over the direction of your company, as well as being able to focus on building the technology/product/company, without the distraction of fundraising. A major disadvantage is not having any income until you sell something, so you have to either do this on the side of your day job, or you have to plan ahead and save some money to support yourself for a while<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a>. And you have to be willing to work on the company for free until it makes money. </p><p>I&#8217;m not making any claims about which way is better, but just making a point that there are different approaches, and it&#8217;s worth considering all of them before making a decision of how you want to build your company.</p><h4>But what about deep tech startups?</h4><p>Deep tech startups are different to regular tech startups<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a>. They need lab space, expensive equipment, and highly qualified personnel. That ain&#8217;t cheap. So the conventional wisdom is that they take even longer to become profitable, and require even more funding.</p><p>It seems like bootstrapping a deep tech company wouldn&#8217;t be possible, but I&#8217;m intrigued about the idea of a maker-space for experimental physicists&#8212;a place with lab space, rooms of lasers, etc, that people could hang out in and tinker with and develop their technologies. </p><p>Isn&#8217;t that called grad school? Yeah, I guess&#8230;but somehow I&#8217;m imagining something different&#8230;something outside of academia. </p><p>I think the Quantum Nanofab Facility at the Quantum Nano Center in Waterloo and DevTeQ at DistriQ in Sherbrooke might be approximations of what I&#8217;m imagining, but I think those are more for already-funded startups to rent out&#8230;and again, I&#8217;m imagining something outside of academia. </p><p>The idea of this kind of maker-space for experimental physicists has independently come up in several conversations I&#8217;ve had in the last month, so I think something might be in the air.</p><h4>So how&#8217;s this new life going so far?</h4><p>I&#8217;m having a wonderful time, but my biggest challenge as always is limiting the number of things that I want to do at once. I&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks talking to a lot of people and getting lots of new ideas, but I need to reign in the networking next week and sit down and actually make some progress on the boring, but oh so important, parts of building the company.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><div><hr></div><h3>Related</h3><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;a7b1fc6e-f7ff-48c3-8e38-cdd73ff745eb&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Last week, I posted on LinkedIn about starting a lifestyle business, and I realized that not everyone will be familiar with that term, especially those from academic backgrounds.

Owners of lifestyle businesses prioritize personal goals, such as flexibility, work-life balance, and the pursuit of their passions, over the traditional business objective of maximizing profits. (<a href="https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/lifestyle-business/">source</a>)</p></blockquote><h3>Hey&#8230;what&#8217;s wrong with profit?</h3><p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m all for companies focusing on profit. Anyone with a pension or any other investment should want the companies they invest in to be profitable. The question is: do <em>I</em>, personally, want to be the builder of such a company. And the answer is: no.</p><p>In recent years, many of my friends and colleagues from academia started quantum tech startups. Such startups are typically backed by venture capital (VC). This means that people with money gave that money to a VC who then invested that money in a startup. At some point, say after 5 to 10 years, those investors will want the money they invested&#8212;plus a handsome profit&#8212;to come back to them. That&#8217;s the name of the game, and I think it&#8217;s great these mechanisms exist. In many cases, it&#8217;s the only way to build the kinds of technology and products that these companies want to build. </p><p>But this puts a great deal of pressure on the company and the founders. I have the absolute utmost respect and admiration for my friends and colleagues who went down this path. It&#8217;s just not for me (at least not now). </p><h3>Don&#8217;t people look down on lifestyle businesses?</h3><p>Some people do. In VC circles, the term <em>lifestyle business</em> is sometimes used pejoratively, suggesting that such businesses lack ambition or potential. This totally makes sense if the thing you care about is a return on your investment. I would not be investing money in someone else&#8217;s lifestyle business either. But lifestyle businesses <em>can</em> be ambitious and have potential in their own way. They can do great work and bring value and satisfaction to their clients. And they can support a sustainable and fulfilling career for their owners. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m after!</p><h3>What kind of lifestyle are you trying to support?</h3><p>According to the definition above, one of the goals of a lifestyle business is that it supports the owner&#8217;s preferred lifestyle. This brings to mind a business that makes enough money, and leaves its owner with enough time, that they can spend their days playing golf or sailing a yacht or something. That&#8217;s not exactly what I&#8217;m interested in though. </p><p>When I left academia, I left for various reasons. Those reasons hold even more true today. But even though I don&#8217;t want to return to academia, I do want to reclaim some of the aspects I loved about it, like autonomy and intellectual freedom. I want control over my schedule and the freedom to choose the people I work with. I want the ability to take long lunches, and the opportunity to engage in deep, intellectual discussions with colleagues. But at the same time, I want the things I discovered I loved while in industry, like speed, execution, big strategic thinking, and connection with the real world. </p><p>I actually really like work&#8230;a lot more than entertainment. I&#8217;m just picky about the nature of that work. The lifestyle that I want to support is the one that lets me work in a way that is right for me, and on things that align with my passions and my values. </p><h3>What&#8217;s up with your funny company name?</h3><p>I thought a lot about what to call the company. I think the name should reflect what a company does, and I couldn&#8217;t settle on doing just one thing. I want to try all of the things and figure out which ones work and which ones don&#8217;t. So I called the company<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> Aggie Branczyk Enterprises (ABE). It&#8217;s the best description of what the company does&#8230;and it makes me laugh. </p><h3>What will the company do?</h3><p>ABE will consist of different divisions, one for each venture, each with its own service/product, business model, and brand identity. I will also leave room for a division called ABE Research, in which I will do foundational research driven by my own curiosity. Like its counterparts in much larger companies such as IBM and GE, the Research division will not directly generate revenue, but will be supported financially by its parent company.</p><p>This sounds like a lot for one person to take on, but my goal is to structure the business in a way that allows me to work at a sustainable pace. In this Substack, I&#8217;ll share how I plan to do that, as well as what I learn along the way as I explore different ventures and business models. I&#8217;ll also talk about why I wanted to think of this as a company rather than to work as a freelancer that takes on various projects (which would have been a lot easier!). </p><h3>Stick around</h3><p>So, here we are. I&#8217;m diving into this journey with excitement and realism, aiming to build something meaningful on my own terms. If you&#8217;re interested in creating a life and work that feels right for you, or if you&#8217;re just curious to see how this experiment unfolds, stick around. I&#8217;ll be glad that you&#8217;re here for the ride. </p><div><hr></div><h3>Related</h3><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;fe5229f6-b36d-4caf-b83a-b4ffd0cb2d74&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Last week, Perimeter Institute hosted a conference on various topics related to casualty and quantum physics.
