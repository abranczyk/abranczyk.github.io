Former academic (physicist) who works in the quantum computing industry by day and thinks about how to do curiosity-driven research by night.

Some things I've made which might be useful:
- [Academics in the Wild](https://academicsinthewild.com): an initiative to support physicists and mathematicians in their journey from academia to industry
- Physicists in the Wild podcast: Interviews with physicists who left academia ([audio](https://physicistsinthewild.buzzsprout.com) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwt2ODY2PX0hnUJgIwCwHSkPzH4J4fVX))
- [DRiP](https://github.com/DRiP-project): A framework for doing research in public
- [Python module](https://github.com/abranczyk/custom-poling) for designing the domain configuration of a nonlinear crystal to approximate a desired phase-matching function.
- My [lectures](https://pirsa.org/speaker/agata-branczyk) on quantum theory from my time at Perimeter Institute
- [Various scientific talks that I've given](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwt2ODY2PX0ZTTHs7xHMPpCZXxwHX9VW&si=hSxU3hFRmEXfWDlW) (some more [here](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/video-archive/2017/08/2405-17470) and [here](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/video-archive/2015/08/382-4951))
- My [course on scientific writing](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwt2ODY2PX1P_23KOr0hs_zMeBHE3Q0d&si=XLrzEtKj1SlFdfdC)
- A [list of my scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TrDQTukAAAAJ&hl=en) on google scholar
- My PhD thesis: [Non-classical states of light](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:220610) ([pdf](/assets/pdf/Branczyk2010_Non-classical_states_of_light.pdf))
