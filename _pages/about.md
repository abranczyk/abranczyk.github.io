ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aggie! I'm a Physicist in the Wild ðŸ¦˜

After my PhD, I spent 10 years in academia doing quantum research, then 4 years in quantum tech (things move ~2.5x faster in industry, so let's call it even!)

Now, with insights from both academia and industry, I'm on a mission to create a life and career that amplifies my favourite aspects of both.

I'm starting a curiosity-and-values-driven company, which I'm building in public. You can read about it [here](https://aggieinc.substack.com/p/whats-a-lifestyle-business). 

I'm also running [Academics in the Wild](https://academicsinthewild.com), a community of physicists and mathematicians learning from each other as we discover new career paths beyond academia.

Some other things Iâ€™ve made which might be useful:
- Physicists in the Wild podcast: Interviews with physicists who left academia ([audio](https://physicistsinthewild.buzzsprout.com) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwt2ODY2PX0hnUJgIwCwHSkPzH4J4fVX))
- [DRiP](https://github.com/DRiP-project): A framework for doing research in public
- [Python module](https://github.com/abranczyk/custom-poling) for designing the domain configuration of a nonlinear crystal to approximate a desired phase-matching function.
- My [lectures](https://pirsa.org/speaker/agata-branczyk) on quantum theory from my time at Perimeter Institute
- [Various scientific talks that I've given](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwt2ODY2PX0ZTTHs7xHMPpCZXxwHX9VW&si=hSxU3hFRmEXfWDlW) (some more [here](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/video-archive/2017/08/2405-17470) and [here](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/video-archive/2015/08/382-4951))
- My [course on scientific writing](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwt2ODY2PX1P_23KOr0hs_zMeBHE3Q0d&si=XLrzEtKj1SlFdfdC)
- A [list of my scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TrDQTukAAAAJ&hl=en) on google scholar
- My PhD thesis: [Non-classical states of light](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:220610) ([pdf](/assets/pdf/Branczyk2010_Non-classical_states_of_light.pdf))
