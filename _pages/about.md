ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aggie! I'm a Physicist in the Wild ðŸ¦˜

After my PhD, I spent 10 years in academia doing quantum research, then 4 years in quantum tech (things move ~2.5x faster in industry, so let's call it even!)

Now Iâ€™m building a company that combines the intellectual freedom and curiosity of academia with the innovation and real-world impact of industry.

Itâ€™s not a startup. Itâ€™s a [lifestyle business](https://open.substack.com/pub/aggieinc/p/whats-a-lifestyle-business). 

[Aggie Branczyk Enterprises](https://open.substack.com/pub/aggieinc/p/nice-company-but-what-does-it-do) is my platform for exploring various venturesâ€”from reserach and quantum tech to career training for PhDsâ€”all aimed at finding the perfect intersection of my interests and market needs. Each project is a step toward creating a sustainable and fulfilling career that aligns with my passions and values. 

 If youâ€™re interested in creating a life and work that feels right for you, or if youâ€™re just curious to see how this experiment unfolds, check out my [Substack](https://aggieinc.substack.com).
