I'm a Senior Research Scientist on the Quantum Computational Science team at [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum). Our goal is to advance quantum science using our quantum computing platform.

Outside of my day job (and sometimes within it), I obsessed over these three questions:  
- How can we run theoretical research collaborations without pre-established social networks?  
- How can we enable those who leave academia to continue doing curiosity-driven research?  
- How can we scale research mentorship for newcomers?  

I coined the term “denizen science”, which I define as the space between professional science and citizen science. It’s where those who left academia, and those who haven’t yet entered it, can do real science…not because it’s their job, but because they love it.

To enable this, I'm developing a framework called [Doing Research in Public (DRiP)](https://github.com/DRIP-project/meta). This is an open-source side project. If you’d like to join this effort, drop me a line.
