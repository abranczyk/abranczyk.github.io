I asked ChatGPT to give me some questions to test my knowledge of quantum cryptography.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/chatgpt-study-buddy-01.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

I then answered one of the questions and asked it to rate my answer.

ChatGPT gave me a rating and provided useful feedback, but it misunderstood part of my answer.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/chatgpt-study-buddy-02.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

After further interaction, ChatGPT understood what I meant and updated my rating.
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/chatgpt-study-buddy-03.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/chatgpt-study-buddy-04.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Way to go, ChatGPT!

With current limitations, you definitely can't use it blindly, but if you understand it's limitations, I think it already makes a useful study tool.
