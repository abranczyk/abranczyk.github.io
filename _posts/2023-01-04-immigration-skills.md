I feel like "immigrated to another country" should be something we can show off on our resume...

It requires so many important skills and personality traits to pull it off successfully.

For example:

- Research and problem-solving skills: Navigating the immigration process can often involve researching and understanding complex laws and regulations, and finding solutions to any problems that may arise.

- Communication skills: Not only do you have to pass language tests (I actually had to do an English test to immigrate from Australia to Canada lol), but getting through the whole process requires good communication skills, both written and verbal, in order to clearly convey information and explain your specific circumstances.

- Organizational skills: Immigration often involves a ridiculous amount of paperwork and documentation (my PR application was a full-sized envelope over an inch thick!) so being organized and keeping track of important documents is crucial.

- Adaptability: The whole process can be unpredictable and may require making quick decisions and adapting to changing circumstances.

- Patience: There are often many different steps involved in the process, and it may take some time to complete each one, not to mention delays or unexpected setbacks along the way.

- Resilience: Anyone who's been through it knows how stressful and challenging it is. You absolutely have to be able to handle setbacks and persevere.
