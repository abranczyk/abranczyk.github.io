Today I'm joining a [Mr Beast-style accountability co-working session](https://lu.ma/k9wclosu?tk=1yEyJQ) at [Builders Club](https://buildersclub.ca). It's my first one. I'm planning to document my progress over the next three hours in this blog post. At the end of the three hours, I'm hitting publish. 

Briefly about the agenda:

​ - **2:00 PM:** Round table check-in and goal-setting for the week and the day

​ - **3:20 PM:** Optional progress check-in to share updates or adjust goals

​ - **4:40 PM:** Wrap-up with optional demos or reflections on completed tasks

Over the last few months, I've been getting more and more interested in two AI-related topics: **AI-assisted coding** and **AI Agents**. I haven't done a good job at making time to dive into these topics, so I decided to use these co-working sessions to make time for that. 

This week I'll start with AI-assisted coding. I'm starting from scratch, so my first step was to ask my friends on the Builders Club slack if they can recommend any workflows and tools to get me started. Here were some responses:

> you can play around here it's fun if you want to get something visual before moving into a code based tool: https://lovable.dev/

> Chatgpt to write a product scope  
> feed it into- https://v0.dev  
> take the code  and scope document and drop it into https://www.cursor.com  
> if you want to skip set up might be useful https://codesandbox.io/  
> (not perfect but cld work!)  

> As always, it depends on “What’s your goal”.  
> If you’re thinking about doing “website-y” stuff, Claude has better support for getting things to work with Javascript and playing with them right in the web browser.  
> ChatGPT just launched “canvas” which does the same thing with Python code, but GUIs aren’t possible there. It’s best for data analysis,  
> In both of those options you have a tool that “writes the code for me” but you still have to get it out of those things to get it to run “the way you want it”. There’s a lot of copy/pasting back and forth between those tools and your IDE.  
> Cursor is arguably the best right now as a VS Code replacement that puts the AI right alongside your code and can work on the errors and bugs as you run them.  
> If I was going to do more than a “light” amount of coding, I would jump into Cursor.

> I’ve been running ollama locally then using the Continue IntelliJ plugin to select the models. Then I download models from huggingface.  

I ordered these in terms of what seems order of difficulty. 

My goal for this co-working session is to start exploring these tools and come up with a concrete proposal for a project to work on in the next co-working session.
