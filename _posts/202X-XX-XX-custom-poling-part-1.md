When you shine light on a nonlinear crystal, some physics (light-matter interaction) happens inside the crystal, which can generate new light at potentially different frequencies. The most useful/interesting interactions happen between either *three* or *four* light fields, which can occur in various combinations, like "one field in and two fields out" or "three fields in and one field out" or "two fields in and two fields out" etc (see [list of different frequency mixing processes on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics#Frequency-mixing_processes)).

The relationship between the input light fields and the generated light fields satisfies energy conservation and momentum conservation (aka phase-matching). So if you want to control the properties of the generated light, you can tweak the properties of the incident light, or the properties of the crystal, which determines the phase-matching. The phase-matching properties are typically fixed for a given material, so your first approach should be to try and find a material that has the phase-matchign properites you want. If you can't find one, you can hack the phase-matching using something called *periodic poling*. Loosely speaking, this is like adding a grating to the crystal that gives you an additional momentum term that you can tune by tweaking the periodicity of the grating.


Periodic poling is a pretty standard method. was a thing in classical nonlinear optics since the 90s or so. The main application was shifting the combination of frequencies  which phase-matching function to shift People also explored aperiodic poling.

Periodic poling was used in per
