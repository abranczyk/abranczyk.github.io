I. 

Maybe you loved science as a kid. Maybe you just fell into it later. However it started, at some point you found yourself doing a physics PhD. It was rough. Long hours. Lack of mentorship. The pay was shit. You never felt good enough compared to your peers. But despite this, it was *awesome*.

Doing research was amazing. Here you were, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. Discovering the mysteries of the universe. Despite all the agony and angst, it was worth it. It was then that you decided that you wanted to dedicate your life to the pursuit of knowledge. For you, being an academic wasn't a job...it wasn't a career...it was *a calling*.

II.

Fast forward a few years and things look different. You're going from postdoc to postdoc. Lack of job security. You're sick of applying for jobs and starting your life over and over again in new places. 

Or you managed to land a tenure-track position but it falls short of what you imagined when you were younger. Too much admin. Too many committees. Too much teaching (in principle you love teaching, but in practice it's a drag). Too many grant applications. Not enough time for research (even when you work nights and weekends). And when you do find the time, you focus on research topics driven by forces other than your own curiosity or thirst for knowledge&mdash;you work on what your colleagues and funding agencies value. Sure, it's fun enough, and it's *important* (look at all the citations and grants you get) but it's not really what you would do if you had the freedom, time, and resources to work on anything you like.

And then you look at your friends who left academia and went into industry. No teaching. Those who are doing research If they're doign research, it looks pretty fun.  The research is  And why shouldn't they be? Industry jobs bring flexibly, financial security, rewarding work, good career prospects, work-life-balance... 

So what keeps you from making the jump? Maybe being an academic is such an integral part of your identity, you wouldn't know who you are if you left. Maybe you like whatever status the position grants you (your colleagues tell you that what you do "matters"; your non-academic friends are jealous because you get paid for doing "what you love"). Maybe you think you wouldn't be able to get a job in the real world even if you wanted to. Maybe you're just resistant to change, or your don't want to lose your physics friends, or you don't want them to think that you're a failure. Maybe you don't want to feel like you wasted the last decade of your life. No shame in any of that. You might be a scientist, but you're still human.

If that's all it is, you can work through it. Many people have and so can you. 

But maybe it's something else?

III. 

Maybe it's that despite the many benefits of getting a job in the real world, and despite the disenchantment you've had with your academic career, you know that as an academic *you still get to do **some** curiosity-driven research* (and you get to call it "work"). Even though the bulk of your research program is the stuff that brings in the funding, you also get to have a "side project" or two...on topics that *you* actually care about. In your head, you see these side projects as your *real work* and everything else (the other 95% of your job) as an annoying distraction (your university sees it the other way around).  

In industry, on the other hand, even in research positions, it's unlikely that you'll be allowed to work on your passion projects while "on the clock" [3]. But even if you are, it'll be clear that this is a privellidge that you're granted because you're valuable and your employer wants to keep you happy, rather than it being considered as part of your job.

Now, there's 



work on your passion projects and pa


you most likely won't be able do work on your passion/side projects as part of your job. And if you're lucky enough you do get to work on them, it will be pretty clear that it's a privelidge that you're granted, rather than 



it's the "side projects" that actually matter to you. They are what *you* consider your *real work*. Giving up 

Even if you're able to process all of your "feelings" about leaving academia, having the freedom to work on passion projects (and calling it "work") can be the hardest thing to give up. 

So you're disenchanted with academia. Industry seems like a decent alternative, but even if you get a research position, the chances that you will be able to do curiosity-driven research are slim [1]. 

Is there a third option?

**Notes**

[1] Unless you have the good luck of beign personally curious about topics in some very niche industries like quantum computing, but even then, positions that allow this kind of research are rare.

[2] Your university sees it the opposite way, but whatever. 

[3] I mean this loosely, since many knowledge work/industry research/tech positions don't strictly track hours.
